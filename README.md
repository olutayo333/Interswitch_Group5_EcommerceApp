INTRODUCTION This project aims to create a multi-tenant ecommerce website with a customizable frontend interface using ReactJS, Redux Tool Kit, NodeJS,  MongoDB,  Java Spring Boot, Lombok, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. The system will be designed as a collection of microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities of the ecommerce platform. The use of microservices architecture enables modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance of the system.

FEATURES Multi-Tenancy: The platform will support multiple tenants, each with its own separate database schema. This allows for isolation of data and configurations between different tenants.

User Management: The system will provide user authentication and authorization functionalities, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.

Product Catalog: Each tenant will have its own product catalog, allowing them to add and update products. Customers can browse through the catalog, view product details, and make purchases.

Category Catalog: Each tenant will have its own category catalog, allowing them to add and update catalog. Customers can browse through the catalog, view catalog details, and add products to category..

Transaction Management: The platform will support transaction management functionalities, allowing users to sell their products, track status by transactionDate,product item and batch number.
